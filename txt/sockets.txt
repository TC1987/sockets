Sockets are used for end to end communication between processes either on the same computer or between 2 different computers. The behavior or client and servers are different. When a server is listening on a specific port, when a client connects to it, a new thread is allocated to handle the work; there is no concurrent connection between the listening port and client's device.

When the server receives a new connection, it does not create a new port to handle the connection; it uses the same identifier as the listening port. Note that it uses the same port identifier as the listening port. The listening port must always be available otherwise any new clients would not be able to connect to it and at most the server would be able to communicate with 1 client at a time.

A socket connection is defined by the server's IP address, port number, client's IP, client's port number, and protocol. Because of a different port number that would be used, the client can connect to a server multiple times.

On the client side, a random dedicated port is selected for the socket connection which means that you can only have ~65K concurrent connections at any given time.

----------------- QUOTES ---------------------

Each port number is dedicated to a corresponding application on the server, and the traffic intended for an application (such as an FTP server or web server) passes through the applicationâ€™s dedicated door.
